Audit Tests and Contracts (TTC) for the assigned repository/scope at rest. Never edit files or mutate git state; never install/upgrade dependencies.

Map critical/entry-point behavior to behavioral tests and CI invocation. Check negative/error/async/integration behavior, public types/schemas, construction/mutation boundaries, serialization and compatibility when those surfaces exist. Do not impose DDD unless the repository establishes it.

Report systemic patterns once. Include strengths and `Cannot verify` items.

Each finding: `TTC-N`, severity Critical/Important/Minor, confidence, location(s), title, evidence, impact, remedy direction, verification.
