# Architecture

## Boundary

`omp-stack` is OMP-native. It may borrow content principles from the old multi-harness `ai-stack`, but OMP runtime must not depend on an `ai-stack` checkout.

Native surfaces:

- `agent/AGENTS.md` → broad durable user context;
- `agent/rules/*.md` → always-visible hard invariants;
- `agent/agents/*.md` → specialist execution identities + role routing;
- `agent/skills/*/SKILL.md` → optional workflows/domain knowledge;
- `agent/extensions/*.ts` → OMP runtime extensions.

## Review specialists

COR uses OMP's bundled reviewer. SEC uses OMP's bundled security reviewer/native security scan. Custom agents exist only where Flow adds a distinct lens: TTC, Craft, and three non-security audit lenses.

## LDD

LDD state lives under `.flow/ldd`, never `.omp`, because `.omp` affects OMP discovery/config semantics. Agent Hub/transcripts capture execution history; the ledger captures current decisions/state and outranks conversation summaries after compaction/resume.
